# ghatika-clock
*Ghatika clock* is an attempt to provide a simple HTML-JS clock web app, to infer the traditional Indian time, which is rooted in sunrise/sunset. According to Dharma Shaastras, a day begins with sunrise and ends at the next sunrise. This interval is divided into two portions - day and night. The day time is further divided into 30 portions (each called a _ghatika_/‡§ò‡§ü‡§ø‡§ï‡§æ/‡§®‡§æ‡§°‡§ø‡§ï‡§æ), and likewise for night. These ghatikas are further divided into 60 portions (‡§µ‡§ø‡§ò‡§ü‡•Ä), and again into 60 portions (‡§§‡§§‡•ç‡§™‡§∞)!

All times for daily rituals are easily specified using this "ghatika" time. For instance, ‡§¨‡•ç‡§∞‡§æ‡§π‡•ç‡§Æ-‡§Æ‡•Å‡§π‡•Ç‡§∞‡•ç‡§§ is from 56-0 to 58-0. The morning Sandhya kaala is from 58-0 to 0-0, the evening Sandhya kaala is from 28-0 to 30-0, and so on.
